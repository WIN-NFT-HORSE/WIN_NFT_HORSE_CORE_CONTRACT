# Public smart contracts


Even though all public contracts' source code will be published on TRON, this repository acts as a centralized place for people to read and review those contracts more easily.

This repository also contains official addresses of Axie Infinity's contracts.

Note: Some contract logics are not fully decentralized as of now. After the development is done, all those logics will be locked so no changes can be made and full decentralization would be achieved.
